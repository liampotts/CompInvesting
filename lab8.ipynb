        "This lab demonstrates how to use [DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108), a light-weight version of BERT that uses many fewer resources while being nearly as accurate on important benchmarks. If you would like to use DistilBERT for your projects, [this Hugginface page](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/distilbert) has links to many different notebooks for various kinds of tasks. *Pro tip: cribbing from other people's Colab notebooks is basically how this kind of work is done. Just make sure to acknowledge your sources.*\n",
        "\n",
        "We will work with two datasets. The first is a freely available set of 50K movie reviews from IMDB, which is available through the Huggingface datasets library. The second is the good old clickbait vs. real news headline database. You will adapt the code I've given you for the IMDB dataset to the clickbait data to show me that you know how to convert your own datasets into the expected format for DistilBERT for classification.\n",
        "\n",

They caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh-so innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation, who made this war happen. The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this. He is extremely patriotic, bemoans that US-Americans didn\\'t appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier, but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians. Like every film that defends the war (e.g. \"We Were Soldiers\") also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in South Asia. And for that matter also the reason for every single US-American soldier that was there. Instead, Rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation. It would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories, rather than suppressing them. \"Do we get to win this time?\" Yes, you do.',\n",
